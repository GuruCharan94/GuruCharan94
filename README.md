Hi, I am Gurucharan from Bangalore, India. I am a Software Engineer at ABB on the Electric Vehicle Chargers team helping build emission free transportation with the help of IoT. I work with .NET, Azure & Azure DevOps. On some days I am Dev, on other days I am Ops and frequently many things in between.

Outside of work, I am a member of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org), co-chair the [Azure User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Microsoft-Azure-Bangalore/) in Bangalore, speak, blog and have more side-projects than I should.
